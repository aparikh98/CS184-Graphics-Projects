<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Often objects are graphically modelled as a mesh. In this project we explore how we can represent
        a mesh using the Half Edge data structure, and develop many tools to edit mesh structures such as
        splitting, flipping and subdividing meshes. We also look at Bezier curves and how we can evaluate
        them using de Casteljau's methods. This project was especially interesting because it provided a
        deeper look into the geometry of shapes, and was a good insight into how many object modelling
        tools work today.
    </p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
    <p>
        In this part of the project, we evaluated Bezier curves based on control points. The process for this was by
        evaluating
        the control points using de Casteljau's algorithm. A Bezier curve is a smooth curve that is parametrized by
        these
        control points. We can use the de Casteljau's algorithm to recursively evaluate the polynomials for the Bezier
        curve.
        Given n control points, the algorithm entails connecting adjacent points, and evaluating them at a parameter t.
        This t (0,1) represents where on
        the line we evaluate the edge. We can connect these n-1 points to get a closer approximation of the curve. We
        can continue
        this process until we evaluate a final point. The completed Bezier curve will pass through this last control
        point.

        Below is the evaluation of this algorithm on 6 control points:

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>
        In part 1, we evaluate a single Bezier curve based on control points. In this section,
        we extend this idea two Bezier surfaces which adds another dimension. Basically we can think
        of this as computing the Bezier curve twice, once in each direction. As in part 1, we evaluate
        each curve along one direction. Then we use each of these curves as the control point in the opposite
        direction. Like part 1, we also have a parameter, we will use u and v, which are analogous to t in
        part 1.

        We can use this to now render mesh objects

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

    <p>
        This part involves using the average normals to provide better shading for a mesh rendering.
        Here we take each vertex, and look at the area weighted average normal vector. What this means
        is that for each vertex we take all the neighboring vertices (look at outgoing edges), and get a
        re-normalized unit vector. The effect of this is we have a much more smooth, realistic looking image.

        This tea pot shows how much smoother this process makes the rendering!

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
    <p>
        Now that we can render images using the half edge data structure, we can take a look at
        editing them. One of these processes is the Half-edge flip. This involves, flipping the
        edge that connects two adjacent triangles. The difficulty in doing this, is while a Half
        edge data structure provides a lot of symmetry, it is a very connected data structure. this
        means that even for a simple operation like this we have to keep track of a lot of pointers.

        This image from CMU CS 15-462 shows how we need to relabel objects
    </p>
    <img src="images/part4/part4_ex.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
    <p>
        The biggest challenge of this was that in renaming a lot of pointers, it is easy to miss some.
        However, by carefully accounting each of these changes, it was fairly straightforward to debug.

        Here you can see how the half edge flip affects an image:

    <figcaption align="middle">Flipping many edges can really change the image</figcaption>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

    <p>
        Here we add another key editing feature for the half edge data structure. Here the half-edge split
        takes a pair of triangles, and adds another edge further dividing it. This part was slightly more
        tricky as compared to the previous one, since we are creating more mesh objects. However, by drawing
        out which pointers should change, this process is also straightforward.

    <img src="images/part5/part5_ex.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>

    <p>
        Let us look at the torus to see how spliting edges can be used to modify the shape:

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
    <p>
        Here we implement upsampling for mesh objects. This is a very interesting process that leverages the previous
        two
        mesh transformations to make images smoother. The goal is for us to make the mesh out of smaller shapes. This is
        done by
        splitting each triangle into 4 smaller triangles. However, when we do this, the scaling is off, so we will also
        update
        the vertex positions. In order to implement this I followed this procedure:
        1. Compute updated positions for existing vertices and edges, marking them as old.
        2. Split every "old" edge, creating two "new" edges and a new vertex
        3. Flip any edge that connects an "old" and a "new" edge
        4. Update the position of the vertices

        By breaking down this procedure into clear steps, it was possible to keep the debugging to a minimum. However,
        one thing
        I found was that while the implementation of flips and splits may look correct, doing hundreds of those
        operations for
        upsampling can bring out those problems.

        Here is an example of how we can upsample a cube:

    <img src="images/part6/part6_2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
    <figcaption align="middle">Cube after 1 upsampling process</figcaption>

    <p>
        This upsampling reduces the sharpness on some images. By presplitting the edges near these transitions, we can
        reduce the effect of this. Notice the handle on top of the teapot. I split some edges along the handle, and as
        we upsample the image, you can see that without the splitting it smooths out more than desired. By presplitting
        them
        we can lessen this effect.

    <p>
        In particular for the cube, we notice that upsampling the image brings out the original asymmetry.
        If you notice the initial mesh diagram of the cube has only one edge through each face. By splitting that edge,
        we can make the appearance of the cube remain symmetric:
